  <p>The privacy of others online is one of my top priorities. We can achieve this by promoting programs that benefit the user's privacy and freedom. I have always been conscious about my privacy online and I think others should too.</p>
  <p>I have always been passionate about computers and how they work. During high school, I began to research alternatives to popular hardware and software, and how to maintain freedom of usage. Most modern systems today contain proprietary hardware, users are not aware of what is running on their computers. I hope to manufacture computers that contain free hardware (hardware that does not contain proprietary code).</p>
  <p>It is important to me that people have freedom when using their own machines, but it is also important that the software is still easy to use. Being innovative and creative, I hope to develop and promote these ideas to the general public and create accessible methods for people to remain independent.</p>
  <p>Thank for taking the time to explore my website.</p>
