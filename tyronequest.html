        <p>Me and my partner Khalil first planned out the story of our game using a tool called Google Docs, we wrote out what the player will fight and what they will encounter on their adventure. Once the story was done, Creately allowed us to create a flow chart of our story.</p>
        <p>A difficulty we encountered while working on this game was that it would loop and crash the program. I fixed this by adding a blank function so that the program can stop when it's supposed to. Another difficulty was the battle system, we weren't sure how to create a real battle system so we opted to have a scripted one.</p>
        <p>The development of this program was collaborative, we both contributed to the code and added additions to the story. Independently, I mostly contributed to fixing bugs.</p>
